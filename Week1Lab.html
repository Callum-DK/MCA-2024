\[CHALLENGES TO MUSIC DATA include: historical data being corrupted, lost or damaged. Copyright or protected data. Low amounts of music data available for new instances or less developed projects. In terms of curation challenges, this could include: busy organisation, overload of data, irrelevant or incosistent data, data-related regulatory and security requirements, business dataset requirements, dataset coding syntax issues. Distribution challenges include: finding platforms for datasets, understanding who needs the dataset, what companies would use it, is it a commerical or personal dataset?, will I sell the dataset?, what is the dataset value?, how do I advertise this dataset? Fragmentation,
Music data is often siloed, with only a few employees having access to data tools. Data can be expensive, high costs. Transparency, ownership complications of music data. AI can generate music without infringing copyright laws. Radio spins is a type of music data but depending on the genre this may not be suitable. HOW DOES MY THEME PRESENT THESE CHALLENGES? My music data will most likely not appear in major archives. Much of my data may be security protected or owned by large franchises. My composer isn't world renouned to the a historical legacy extent so data levels may be limited. My music data will be under ownership of more people than just my chosen composer. My data may not be present on many established music data sites. HOW IS DATA FOR MY THEME PRESENTED? Fully annotated western modern sheet music available on MuseScore and MusicNotes PPP. Lists the artist, show and type of sheet music weather it be Tab or annotated. Audio files sectioned into categories such as film, artist production and video games. Laballed and titled in creative ways. Audio available on most major music platforms like spotify and soundcloud and youtube...Metadata structured into menus such as general, more info, audio channels, date and time, file size, format, comments, sample rate, and duration. Hooktheory website provides chord and melody metrics such as chord and melodic complexity, chord melody tension and chord progression novelty. It also talks about key popularity. Midi file representations. Audio files on soundcloud have tags and groupings. Apple music has info menus detailing art work, lyrics, file and sorting. Musescore goes into viewing figures as well as page numbers. Other platforms expand on this with views, likes and shares.
