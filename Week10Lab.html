  <h1>Week[10]</h1>
  
  <p>Music Analyticâ€™s</p>

<p>
  For this weeks lab, I have opened the python notebook template from the moodle.
  I have uploaded the collection from the moodle to the python notebook. I have replaced
  the country tracks with the same tracks I used for last weeks lab. I have extracted the chroma
  features in sonic visualiser and exported the features as CSV files which I have replaced in the 
  relevant area within the collection folder. See picture:
