  <h1>Week[10]</h1>
  
  <p>Music Analyticâ€™s</p>

<p>
  For this weeks lab, I have opened the python notebook template from the moodle.
  I have uploaded the collection from the moodle to the python notebook. I have replaced
  the country tracks with the same tracks I used for last weeks lab. I have extracted the chroma
  features in sonic visualiser and exported the features as CSV files which I have replaced in the 
  relevant area within the collection folder. See picture:

    I used the python notebook template to generate a similarity matrix. My files which replaced the country tracks are labelled 7, 8 and 9. Follow this link for the html output:
