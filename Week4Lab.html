CHORDIFY

With my file 'Tyler Bates GOTG Main Theme XML.musicxml' loaded into python, I was able to start analysis on it.
Chordify was on the first processes I dealt with. I used the code from the python notebook to create a chordify command
which was then written into a new music xml files readable through Musescore or a text editor. The chords were complex so 
another command was used to simpify them into the closed position.
    
 
HARMONIC ANALYSIS
    
Attempted this step, however I could not find a solution to the error message "attribute error" will ask this in class.
The following code was used: 

PAnalysis = pChords
for c in pAnalysis.recurse().getElementsByClass('Chord'):
    rn = roman.romanNumeralFromChord(c, key.key('F'))
    c.addLyric(str(rn.figure))
pAnalysis.write('musicxml' , fp="chordAnalysis.xml")

This triggered an attribute error message in cell in[53], line 3. The roman numeral code section. The specific error in question
was defined as "module 'music21.key' has no attribute 'key'
    

DATA STREAM AND GETTING THE AMBITUS

"Music21 can extract the range of a particular voice or instrument. To do this, you will need to figure out which 
part you would like to analyze. If you are struggling to determine that, you can review the stream structure we 
displayed above. If you do know the part, use the following, substituting the 0 with the proper part number:"

"﻿﻿Music 21 stores files in a stream, which is a data structure spaced in time. So, each object has an offset that 
epresents how many quarter notes it lies from the beginning. A stream can (and often does) contain other streams for scores, parts, and measures."
For extracting the range of my chosen instrument within my score, I have referred to the stream structure to locate the part number. The following line of code was identified.
‹music 1.stream.Part Bb Trumpet 1>
My part number is 1, Upon inputing code to receive the Ambitus the following result was obtained:
‹music 1.interval.Interval M17> 


PIANO ROLL OF PITCHES, PITCH HISTOGRAM, SCATTER PLOT OF PITCHES

I generated all three of these. For the Piano roll of pitches I used the part number 3 which referred to the Horn in F
and this was confirmed by referencing the music data stream. The piano roll was created for measures 1 through to 42. 
This generated a graph with measure numbers linked to pitches on an x and y basis. 

Upon generating the Pitch Historgram, I noted the x axis gave me the number of pitches and the y axis gave me the note
and octave from C1 to C6 and so on. 

Upon generating the Scatter Plot of Pitches I was at first confusded with the layout. I now understand that the quarter length
on the y axis refers to the note length and the x axis gives us the note pitch and octave. Both the Scatter Plot and Histogram
were useful in giving a full represenation of the entire score whereas the piano roll was useful for isolating a particular
instrument.
