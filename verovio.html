        <p>[First noticeable difference on a readable scale is that some notation within the XML 
            file is colour coded Upon reading the XML handbook, it is concluded that this is due to the fact 
            Musescore considers the skill level of the musician and the range capabilities of an instrument. 
            Coloured notes that appear red are outside the range of a professional player and they are olive 
            green/dark yellow if outside the range of an early amateur. This only happens upon reading the file 
            on a computer and not on the printed score. The MEI file as viewed in Verovio does not offer this 
            feature. 

            Upon opening both the XML and MEI files in a text editor. Within the XML file code for rhythm is 
            split into many lines such as Time, Beats, number, Beat type. Every variable or element has to be 
            opened and closed separately whereas on MEI you can have multiple elements described in one line. 
            For example instrument definition, midi channel and midi volume in one bracket. Information related 
            to a chosen element can be kept within the same bracket on a MEI file. In MusicXML, individual 
            movements are usually represented as separate files.

            <MEI Head> followed by <Music> then <Body> then the code descriptions of the notation is in chronological 
                order.  The parent attributes in MEI appear to have rankings in the sense that the <MEI Head> function 
                    holds all the code  and the level of jurisdiction lowers with each subsequent child heading. 
                    Whereas in Music XML it appears the parent head or root element is <score partwise>. 
                        XML then appears to be more organised with Top Level elements which contain grouped lower 
                        level elements that contain the musical data. It would seem that Music XML has more parent
                        and child grouping compared with MEI. This would explain why music xml has over ten thousand 
                        lines of code compared with a few hundred lines with MEI code. 


              MEI provides greater affordances for encoding semantically and gaining more structurally rich metadata
                        for machine reading whereas it is clear that XML is superior in capturing notation and its 
                        layout. It Is clear that MEI is additionally providing intellectual content about the 
                        notation rather than just its appearance or structure. It is also noted that MEI includes 
                        XML IDs to reference.]</p></div>
