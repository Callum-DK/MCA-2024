CHORDIFY

With my file 'Tyler Bates GOTG Main Theme XML.musicxml' loaded into python, I was able to start analysis on it.
Chordify was on the first processes I dealt with. I used the code from the python notebook to create a chordify command
which was then written into a new music xml files readable through Musescore or a text editor. The chords were complex so 
another command was used to simpify them into the closed position.
    
 
HARMONIC ANALYSIS
    
Attempted this step, however I could not find a solution to the error message "attribute error" will ask this in class.
The following code was used: 

PAnalysis = pChords
for c in pAnalysis.recurse().getElementsByClass('Chord'):
    rn = roman.romanNumeralFromChord(c, key.key('F'))
    c.addLyric(str(rn.figure))
pAnalysis.write('musicxml' , fp="chordAnalysis.xml")

This triggered an attribute error message in cell in[53], line 3. The roman numeral code section. The specific error in question
was defined as "module 'music21.key' has no attribute 'key'
    

DATA STREAM AND GETTING THE AMBITUS

"Music21 can extract the range of a particular voice or instrument. To do this, you will need to figure out which 
part you would like to analyze. If you are struggling to determine that, you can review the stream structure we 
displayed above. If you do know the part, use the following, substituting the 0 with the proper part number:"

"﻿﻿Music 21 stores files in a stream, which is a data structure spaced in time. So, each object has an offset that 
epresents how many quarter notes it lies from the beginning. A stream can (and often does) contain other streams for scores, parts, and measures."
For extracting the range of my chosen instrument within my score, I have referred to the stream structure to locate the part number. The following line of code was identified.
‹music 1.stream.Part Bb Trumpet 1>
My part number is 1, Upon inputing code to receive the Ambitus the following result was obtained:
‹music 1.interval.Interval M17>
