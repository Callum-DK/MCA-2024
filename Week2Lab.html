  <h1>Week[2]</h1>
  
  <p>Music Analytic’s</p>

  <p>
    For todays lab, I selected my piece of music for my theme to download and edit.
    I downloaded the sheet notation as a PDF file:
  </p>
<p>
  <a href=”GOTG Main Theme.pdf” download>Download PDF</a>
</p>
  

<p>
Guardians of the galaxy main theme score by Tyler Bates PDF converted to an mscz file for use in Musescore.
</p>

<p>
Optical character recognition - pixel by pixel analysis for text. Sheet notated music is complicated. Depending on the print and file type, there
may be Stray pixels or other Inconsistencies. The OCR machine must learn relationships. If the sheet notation is not original print then it is 
not linked with rules or part of the sequence.
</p>

<p>
About Muse score discussion: It is Not great with manuscripts. Old or historical sheet music where modern western standards may not
be applied will confuse Musescore as the system is learning with up to date rules. To sum up before going into detial. When I uploaded my PDF
to genereate the musescore file these were immediate problems: it added 120tempo markings, some notes were out of line, Musescore added row numbers.
Muse score added accidentals. Muse score added articulations. Separation of notes has changed. Beat rests added. Time signature not present in some cases.
</p>

<p> 
Areas where Musescore failed:
</p>

  <p>
Tempo assumed to be 120BPM when the correct tempo was actually 107BPM according to the sheet notation original PDF. 
  </p>

  <p>
Instruments all labeled as voices when they were actually 5 separate instruments.
  </p>

  <p>
9th staff bar 1 after the triplet we have a duplet and a semi quaver, Musescore has changed this into 3 semi quavers. It has done the same on bar 2 and 3 on the 9th staff
  </p>

  <p>
Staff 21 - 25 missing time signature 2/4 on Musescore, Should be present in Bar 3
  </p>

  <p>
Staff 36-40 also missing key signature on bar 3, musescore not presenting the 2/4 again.
  </p>

<p>
Staff 39 the dynamic of crescendo hairpin is only covering the dotted quaver in musescore when on the original it covers the quaver and dotted duplet. 
</p>

<p>
46-50 we are missing key signatures Missing Ab major or F minor on Musescore. 
</p>

<p>  
As a result of replacing in the correct key signature, many notes were automatically given accidentals ie Sharps. 
</p>
  
<p>
51-55 staff have incorrect crescendo hairpins on bar 2 in Musescore.
</p>

<p>
Final section we have an extra bar of rests added by Musescore, a missing time signature of 4/4, missing crescendo.
</p>

<p>
Having trouble removing added rests and replacing with 4/4 signature but want to keep only three bars and prevent notes from shifting…
