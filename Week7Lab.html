The notesStmt element is the sixth component of the fileDesc element and is optional. If used, it contains one or
more annot elements, each containing a single piece of descriptive information of the kind treated as ‘general notes’ 
in traditional bibliographic descriptions.

Had issue with publisher metadata, wasn’t expecting Publisher within the pubStmt element. I referred to the MEI guidlines 
and it stated that publisher was contained by pubStmt so I struggled to find the issue. However it was due to publisher
having a Capital P rather than a lower case p, in which case it was allowed to be contained by pubStmt and not regarded as extra content.

Adding licensing data, availability as the parent element which is contained by pubStmt. Child element useRestrict contained within 
availability allows me to state the license applied to my score. I decide on the following license: 
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International by using online tool:
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/" title="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/">https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/</a>
</p>

<p>
Here is my final mei file with the metadata and data links correctly encoded:

Upon rendering the MEI file with GitHub metaRaw.html by placing the MEI file
path in the relevant spaces after uploading the raw file to my repository, I was 
able to see the metadata appear at the top. However, It was displayed unformatted 
and just as long sentence not separated by commas. Crowded, poorly formatted 
and messy. You can view this here: <a href="https://callum-dk.github.io/MCA-2024/metaRAW.html" title="https://callum-dk.github.io/MCA-2024/metaRAW.html">https://callum-dk.github.io/MCA-2024/metaRAW.html</a>
</p>

</p>
How would I improve this?:
</p>

<p>
Use of field names avoiding hyphens, spaces, slashes, and special characters. I could use 
Excel and CSV by creating columns, with the field name in the first column and the field 
value in the second column. I could then link this excel document as a downloadable file or 
set up a preview. An interesting find was Markdown. I could use Markdown files to store metadata 
that requires a list, such as tags. I can use Markdown to bolden important text. Markdown files 
can be converted to HTML to be displayed for viewing. I could make use of exporting by using a 
drop-down list to export metadata to a standard format, such as FGDC CSDGM, ISO 19115-3, ISO 19139, or INSPIRE. 	
</p>

<p>
I noticed that the order in which the data was presented was chronological in relation to each line of code from 
the MEI file. I would first like to change the order but rearranging the code so that the data is displayed in a 
logical order.
</p>

<p>
Title, Composer, Publisher, Publication Date, Distributor, Genre, License, Encoding Date. 
</p>

<p>
Upon attempting this, I realise that this isn’t as simple as it seems. Due to certain Parent 
elements containing certain child elements following the MEI Guidelines and metadata standards, 
this means we cannot place certain metadata into the wrong containers. 
</p>

<p>
I realised that I wanted to add a publication date as I thought this would be useful in relation to the license. 
It will give a user an idea on how old or new the piece is which can justify the permissions granted or not granted 
via licensing. I believe it will encourage users to stay up to data on an artists work and decide how relevant a piece 
of work is in relation to the time period the user is in.	
</p>

Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International

<p>
I chose this license because my piece is still fairly new and it is protected by copyright and not in the public 
domain. Placing a non profit rule on the license seems logical for the piece I have. If the piece is attached to a 
large mainstream company (Marvel) and bringing in large amounts of credit to the owner, they may want to protect the 
idea in order to prevent other artists capitalising off of their original idea. With no-derivatives. I believe this 
strengthens this protection even further. However, as it is still CC and the piece can be used or stored privately, 
this still allows for popularity and publicity of the piece to flow as credit to the owner must be given if the piece 
is copied and distributed. CC encourages innovation and sharing. If a large amount of work has gone into the piece, 
then this license protects the reward from that. Another point to expand on the point of a piece of work coming from 
a mainstream source that is going to be widely sought upon and well known. Having any kind of Creative Commons license 
means that uses have been pre-approved and that the owner does not need to converse with permission seekers on a one 
by one basis to grant approvals. This will be useful if many thousands of people want to use the work. A notable downside
of Creative Commons is that it is irrevocable. So it is important to make a correct and informed choice.
