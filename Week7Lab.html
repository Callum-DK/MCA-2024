The notesStmt element is the sixth component of the fileDesc element and is optional. If used, it contains one or
more annot elements, each containing a single piece of descriptive information of the kind treated as ‘general notes’ 
in traditional bibliographic descriptions.

Had issue with publisher metadata, wasn’t expecting Publisher within the pubStmt element. I referred to the MEI guidlines 
and it stated that publisher was contained by pubStmt so I struggled to find the issue. However it was due to publisher
having a Capital P rather than a lower case p, in which case it was allowed to be contained by pubStmt and not regarded as extra content.
