The notesStmt element is the sixth component of the fileDesc element and is optional. If used, it contains one or
more annot elements, each containing a single piece of descriptive information of the kind treated as ‘general notes’ 
in traditional bibliographic descriptions.

Had issue with publisher metadata, wasn’t expecting Publisher within the pubStmt element. I referred to the MEI guidlines 
and it stated that publisher was contained by pubStmt so I struggled to find the issue. However it was due to publisher
having a Capital P rather than a lower case p, in which case it was allowed to be contained by pubStmt and not regarded as extra content.

Adding licensing data, availability as the parent element which is contained by pubStmt. Child element useRestrict contained within 
availability allows me to state the license applied to my score. I decide on the following license: 
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International by using online tool:
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/" title="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/">https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/</a>

Here is my final mei file with the metadata and data links correctly encoded:

Upon rendering the MEI file with GitHub metaRaw.html by placing the MEI file
path in the relevant spaces after uploading the raw file to my repository, I was 
able to see the metadata appear at the top. However, it was crowded, poorly formatted 
and messy. You can view this here: <a href="https://callum-dk.github.io/MCA-2024/metaRAW.html" title="https://callum-dk.github.io/MCA-2024/metaRAW.html">https://callum-dk.github.io/MCA-2024/metaRAW.html</a>
</p>

</p>
How would I improve this?:
</p>

<p>
Use of field names avoiding hyphens, spaces, slashes, and special characters. I could use 
Excel and CSV by creating columns, with the field name in the first column and the field 
value in the second column. I could then link this excel document as a downloadable file or 
set up a preview. An interest find was Markdown. I could use Markdown files to store metadata 
that requires a list, such as tags. I can use Markdown to bolden important text. Markdown files 
can be converted to HTML to be displayed for viewing. I could make use of exporting by using a 
drop-down list to export metadata to a standard format, such as FGDC CSDGM, ISO 19115-3, ISO 19139, or INSPIRE.
